# Uncle Joes Recruitment site

This project represents my first exploration into Django! I leveraged this website to organize and assess 200 applicants for a student organization in order to identify 20 premier candidates. In further iterations of this site, I would build out a more through "recruiter side" and also the styling needs a complete overhaul (this application was built before I had much HTML and CSS knowledge and has been on my back burner of fix-it items for a while!).
